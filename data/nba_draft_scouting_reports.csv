1,Phoenix,DeAndre Ayton,7-0,260,C,Arizona,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/deandre-ayton,"Posesses can't miss talent with the chance to develop into a generational big ... Seven-footer with great coordination and fluidity ... Great size and length with a 7'5.5 wingspan and 9'3 standing reach ... Runs the floor well with great agility ... Good strength level as well as body frame. Very good footwork ... Can score from every spot on the floor. Shoots well from three with great rotation on his shot. Good free throw shooter, shot 82.1% over the Nike EYBL ... Great athlete. Can play above the rim and is a very reliable finisher ... Shot 60.2% from the field over the Nike EYBL. Can finish plays that no defense can contest. Great rebounder on both ends of the floor. Secures any rebound he can get a hand on ... Great shot blocker and protects the paint. Alters shots that he doesn't block and redirects the offense away from the paint. Does a great job of knowing when to leave his feet and when to stay on the ground to avoid fouls. Very good defender ... Hedges screens and moves his feet well. Reads and jumps passing lanes incredibly well ... Sees the floor well. Constantly communicates and directs traffic on offense and defense. Has great awareness, understands game plan and reads the game well. Knows where he's passing before he receives the ball. Consistently finds the cutter. Plays a great high/low game when paired with another big man. Knows how to run the pick and roll/pick and pop ... Unselfish and patient offensively ...

Isn't afraid of physicality and plays well through contact ... Constantly attracts the defense's attention. Reads double teams well ... Good ball handling and passing ability for his size ... Doesn't have any major weaknesses ...","Ayton didn't make the strides one would hope in his senior year ... He did seem more focused towards the end of the season after losing his #1 player in class status nearly universally, but it appeared he got too comfortable sitting at the top spot for too long ... He rarely played like he had anything to prove and was complacent offensively ... He also turned down the opportunity to compete at the Hoop Summit, an event he had failed to impress at in past years ... Tends to settle for jump shots and roams to the perimeter far too often ... Can assert himself better as he can go through the motions ... Sometimes goes through stretches where he isn't involved with the offense ... Must improve intensity and competitive nature ... His jump shot is flat and doesn't have ideal arc, most of his misses tend to take hard bounces off the rim ... Post game is developing but still needs polish, doesn't have any go to moves ... Needs to understand playing aggressive without wearing emotions and picking up frustration fouls ... Showed some ability to put the ball on the floor and drive but still resorts to jab stepping and settling for a shot ... As an elite level high school bigman, the focus is always to challenge himself as there are plenty of nights where the competition level allows for complacency ... "
2,Memphis,Marvin Bagley,6-11,235,PF,Duke,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/marvin-bagley,"NBA-ready body ... Positional versatility ...

Gets his defenders off balance with an array of ball fakes ... Does a good job of working around the rim and getting himself open ... Has shown the ability to expand his game and take his opponents off the dribble using his quick foot speed ... He's shown flashes of being able to take his game beyond the 3-point line ... Has the potential to be a stretch 4/5 and a catch-and-shoot player ... Solid shooting form and can develop into a reliable mid-range/outside shooter shooter at the next level ... He has developed a nice mid-range jumper, which he can get off of turnarounds or on step back moves ... Plays well from the triple threat position, including a nice jab step ... Has the tools to be a dual pick-and-roll threat ... Offensive rebounding/nose for the ball ... Reacts quickly to rebound his own misses ... Has a knack for turning offensive rebounds into second-chance points, especially in traffic ... He keeps possessions alive and shows great timing cleaning up after missed shots ... Can take a defensive rebound and go coast to coast, either finishing in the lane or setting up a teammate for an open shot ... Has the ability to run the floor paired with the agility to euro-step in big spaces and decelerate ... Decent, but not elite, instincts for defending the rim and blocking shots ... Can effectively challenge shooters using his length in isolation situations to force contested shots ... He's great at switching in pick-and-roll situations ... Can stay in front of guards and wings on the perimeter ... Jumps passing lanes well ... Can be a menace on defense when he's locked in ... Coach K has praised his practice habits and work ethic ... Has built a strong reputation as a high character kid ... Has the desire to be great ... Motor is one of his strongest assets ... Plays with great competitiveness and physicality ... Out-works and out-hustles his opponents ... Commands the ball and looks to dominate ... One of the youngest prospects available for this year's draft. Won't turn 20 years old until March of his rookie season ... Appears to potentially be an ideal small ball five for today's NBA ... ","Lacks the wingspan of other big men in his class ... Has to continue to fill out his frame with upper and lower body strength ... Sometimes gets out-muscled in the paint/post ... Lack of strength keeps him from controlling the paint on defense ... Ball handling is solid but still needs to get better handling in tight spaces ... Needs to prove that he can score consistently with his right hand (i.e. dribbling and finishing with his right) ... Will turn down good looks with his right hand to shoot contested shots with his left ... Even if he's forced right, he'll try to finish with his left ... Needs to trust his right hand more and not be too predictable with his dribble drive and post up moves ... Low post game needs to get more refined ... Far from a finished product in terms of outside shooting, although he's developing ... Because he crashes the offensive glass so often, he doesn't get back in transition as much as he should ... Not a natural passer ... Overlooks open shooters ... Can sometimes miss the easy pass ... Plays toward the basket with tunnel vision ... Isn't a physical screen setter (avoids contact) ... Although he's a great rebounder and puts up great numbers on the boards, it's more so because of his athleticism than his rebounding fundamentals ... Doesn't get good leverage on box outs ... He's not a true rim protector at this point ... Fails to challenge shots at the rim because he tends to shy away from contact ... Still needs to improve his defensive fundamentals, timing, and rotations ... Ball-watches a lot on defense ... Shot just 62% from the charity stripe ... Seems to be a jack of all trades but master of none ..."
3,Dallas,Jaren Jackson Jr.,6-11,240,PF,Michigan St.,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/jaren-jackson-jr,"6'10 athletic big man with great length (7'4 wingspan and 9'1 standing reach) ... Good athleticism, energy, and activity ... Mobile, well-coordinated, and fluid ... Good hands and touch around the basket ...

Great defensive potential ... Good timing as a shot blocker and gets off the ground quickly ... Rotates and moves his feet well ... Has ability to shoot from outside and has a quick release ... Shows potential as a stretch big man ... Can play the pick and pop ... Good free throw stroke ... Draws several fouls per game ... Solid court vision, passing ability, and understanding of the game ... Spaces the floor well offensively ... Shoots the quick three at times but knows his role as a big man ... Doesn't try to do too much ... Can put the ball on the floor and get to the basket when given a straight-line attack opportunity from inside the arc ... Willing screener ... Fits the mold for ideal big man in today's NBA ... Young for his class, won't turn 18 until the middle of September of his freshman year ...","Low release on his shot, could use more arc ... Sometimes rushes it and pushes it from his chest without getting it into the shooting pocket ... Shoots quick at times from three and looks off balanced ... Tends to lean forward on free throws ... Post game is raw. Lacks technique around the basket ... Doesn't handle double teams well ... At time he tries to put the ball on the floor in traffic, resulting in turnovers ... Solid strength level and frame but will need to get stronger moving forward ... Can improve finishing in traffic and handling contact ... Would be more dominant if he were to develop more of a mean streak, and play with a little more emotion ... May struggle some for playing time as a frehman playing with Nick Ward and Miles Bridges ... "
4,Atlanta,Luka Doncic,6-8,225,SG/SF,Slovenia,Intl.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/luka-doncic,"What's most impressive about him is the maturity and the polish and completeness of his game at just 16 years of age, basically from all standpoints ... As a 6-7 SG, he already has a solid body, ready to compete at the senior level, with a wide frame, quite developed from a muscular standpoint, both his upper and lower body ... He has shown a remarkable amount of pro moves and amazing body control during his first season with the Real Madrid senior team ... His game is already defined and complete, with the ability to create his own shot basically in any kind of situation: midrange game, layups, floater, three pointers are all an effective part of his offensive repertoire ... Furthermore his court vision and ball handling skills are above average, with the ability to create for himself and his teammates in traffic often showing glimpses of rare talent ... He often switches as the primary ball handler, where he can show his creativity and ability to attack the basket ... Defensively he has quick hands and instincts in the passing lanes, with a great attitude and a blue collar style ... Definitely one of the brightest prospects coming from Europe in a number of years ... ","His biggest flaw is his lack of quickness and lateral speed, which affects his effectiveness in 1 on 1 defense against more explosive opponents ... Furthermore this also limits his offensive effectiveness in ISO situations when he has to rely on his body control and fakes to create the space for the shot or to draw contact ... He also needs to work on shot consistency, especially his mechanics and foot positioning ... Sometimes he lacks the killer instinct when facing weaker opponents ... "
5,Orlando,Michael Porter,6-10,215,SF,Missouri,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/michael-porter,"It's not often that you find an elite level size/shooter/athlete package at the high school level ... Extremely mature, focused and hard working individual ... Smooth and athletic wing forward with high level intangibles and competitiveness ... Possesses tremendous size for a wing forward at 6'10 with a 7'0 wingspan and 9'0 foot standing reach ... Could transition to being a face up four in today's ""play up a position"" NBA ... Possesses good coordination, fluidity, and versatility ... Smooth shooting stroke with proper form, rotation, and arc ... Draws fouls at a high rate ... Reliable free throw shooter, shot 81.2% over the Nike EYBL and 86% his senior year at Nathan Hale. Gets great elevation with his shot combined with his size and length, can rise and shoot over the top of the defense ... Excels in catch and shoot situations as well as one or minimal dribble pull ups ... Highly efficient and consistent scorer ... A pure shooter ... Shot very well from three at 47% his senior year ... Nearly automatic from midrange ... Threat to score from anywhere within the half court ... Moves well off the ball ... High level athlete with great run and jump ability, especially at his height ... Finishes well in transition ... Quick off the ground. Has impressive second jump, giving him an edge on tip-ins and put backs. Good rebounder ... Crashes offensive boards after nearly every missed shot ... Plays well within the offense; doesn't force his scoring or try to do too much. Squares up on the move and gets his feet set quickly. Stays balanced and shows good body control when he shoots on the move. Uses screens and curls well ... Plays the baseline well ... Has good potential as a perimeter defender with his length and ability to move his feet. Solid shot blocking ability ... Solid court vision and passing ability ... Strength has improved over the past year ...","Better ability to attack the rim off the bounce would add to his scoring arsenal ... Tends to rely on shooting over the defense in the half court ... Ball handling has improved but still needs to improve his overall ball skills, especially with his left hand ... Straight line driver lacking in creativity and doesn't break down the defense ... Doesn't create much off the dribble or have a lot of shiftiness in his game ... Has to move without the ball and have separation before receiving it to create space ... Relies on outjumping opponents at this stage, will need to improve offensive game moving forward ... His pull up game can be predictable and won't come as easy at the next level ... If his shot isn't falling, he doesn't always have a way to get easy baskets ... Can improve his offensive post game ... Doesn't make many decisions with the ball in a triple threat position, generally shoots off the catch or looks to give the ball up after minimal dribbles ... His aggression and physicality doesn't always match his natural ability ... Should look to add strength and toughness ... Playing against more physical defenders moving forward may take some adjusting ... Can improve upon finishing in traffic ..."
6,Chicago,Trae Young,6-2,180,PG,Oklahoma,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/trae-young,"Trae Young early on in his freshman season is doing things that college basketball fans rarely see ... Through Oklahoma's first ten games, he averaged nearly 30 points and nine assists per game, which is unheard of for any player let alone a freshman ... Young has also yet to score fewer than 22 points since the season opener ... Young is just the fourth high-major freshman guard in seven years to record a usage rate higher than 30 percent ... Two of those players, [Player: D'Angelo Russell] and <a class='nba_player-link' href='/players/markelle-fultz'>Markelle Fultz</a>, were top-two draft picks ... The first thing that jumps out about Young is his seemingly limitless shooting range ... Young is a threat to score from anywhere on the court once he crosses half court and can effortlessly knock down shots beyond the NBA three-point line ... He may be the best shooter in college basketball since <a class='nba_player-link' href='/players/stephen-curry'>Stephen Curry</a> played at Davidson ... What separates Young from other great shooters is that, like Curry, he has the ability to knock down shots from distance off a variety of dribble moves and not just off the catch or off of simple one-dribble pull ups ... He has a quick, compact release with minimal wasted motion that allows him to get his shot off even in tight space ... Young's jumper unlocks numerous other options offensively for him ... Although he is not the most explosive athlete, the threat of his jumper forces defenders to guard him way out on the perimeter, making it easier for him to get by his man and into the paint ... Young has shown the ability to create his own shot from inside the arc with a solid handle ... He has a great floater from the mid range area as well that he can score with consistently when he is not able to get all the way to the rim ... Young's ability to operate out of the pick and roll is very advanced for a player of his age ... He makes great decisions and quick reads off of ball screens and is always under control ... Young always plays with his head up in these situations and shows great vision in the half court and in transition ... He puts his passes on target and in spots on the court where his teammates are comfortable playing ... He also does a nice job of not forcing passes and making the simple play when nothing extra is needed ... In transition, Young does an excellent job of leading the break and is dangerous due to his combination of vision and craftiness around the rim ... When he goes to the basket, he is adept at using his body to shield himself from bigger defenders and finish through contact ... He can score with both hands or dish it to open teammates to lead to an easy basket. ","Young does not have ideal size at 6-2 or length with just a 6-2 wingspan for an NBA guard ... These physical limitations can become apparent once he gets all the way to the rim ... He lacks the length and vertical explosiveness to finish through NBA length and athleticism and does not project as an efficient scorer at the basket in the NBA ... He will have to rely much more on craft to be successful inside at the next level ... He has been a bit turnover prone at times this season due to his tendency to make some risky passes at times ... However, much of that is due to his unusually high usage rate, and he still has an assist to turnover ratio of better than two to one ... Young's shot selection at times leaves a lot to be desired ... As good of a shooter as he is, there are times where he will hoist a very long jumper early in the shot clock without moving the ball and looking for a better opportunity first ... As polished as Young is offensively, he is a near liability on defense ... He rarely gets into a stance on this end of the floor and shows poor effort guarding the ball ... Opposing guards are easily able to get into the lane against him and he is often caught ball-watching when his man does not have the ball ... Due to his lack of ideal size and athleticism, he will be a guy for opposing offenses to attack ... He is not explosive enough to stay in front of quick guards, and he is also not big enough to stop anyone else on the court ... The effort has to improve first and foremost, but even if it does he may never be a reliable defensive player unless he can create a high number of steals ... Will need to add strengh to be able to better finish off drives and also defend ... "
7,Sacramento,Wendell Carter,6-10,260,PF/C,Duke,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/wendell-carter,"6'10 mobile big man ... Very good length with a 7'3 wingspan and 9'0 standing reach ... Good half court explosive ability, gets good lift when dunking and rebounding. Gets off the ground quickly ... Consistently runs the floor ... Has the strength to establish post position as well as holding his ground when defending the post ... Solid post-game for his age. Good jump hook ... Nice combination of strength and finesse ... Reliable hands with soft touch around the basket ... Can finish with either hand within close ... Scores well in traffic and doesn't shy away from contact ... Very efficient scorer, shot 70.9% from the field over the Nike EYBL ... Draws a lot of fouls and attention from the defense ... Very good rebounder ... Secures most boards in his area ... Crashes the offensive glass. Reliable cleaning up around the basket ... Finishes strong and powerful when dunking ... Good shot mechanics and improved shooting his senior year, looking more confident and not hesitating. Has range out to the three-point line and can shoot off the dribble ... Improved as a free throw shooter ...Can put the ball on the floor and attack in a straight line. Handles the ball well enough to make a move on the perimeter in isolation or take a rebound to the other end ... Sees the floor and passes well for his size. Shows good awareness and keeps the ball moving, understands when to pass out of the post and knows where the open man is when help defense or double team comes ... Stays active, fights for post position and doesn't expect the ball handler to find him ... Active hands. Good shot blocker, led adidas Nations with two per game and averaged 2.5 per game over the Nike EYBL ... Contests shots without picking up unnecessary fouls. Rotates well defensively ... Has shed some baby fat and is willing to improve his body ... ","While he can explode up, he's not much of a transition finisher. Has a solid vertical but is not much of a run and jump athlete. Sometimes the last player up the court ... Isn't very quick when reacting on defense and closing out to contest shooters ... Post-game while sound, is still in early stages of development ... Needs to add more technique with his foot work, moving forward, to allow him more success when he doesn't have a physical advantage ... Tries to attack the set defense too often ... Has a strong body but has a thick build that may add weight if he doesn't emphasize staying in shape ... One of the more ready players moving forward but lacks the upside some of the other big men in his class possess ... May ultimately be a small 5 due to his lack of ideal foot speed ... While solid, he didn't have a great set of All American games or practices. Didn't separate himself among the other big men and had quiet performances overall ..."
8,Cleveland,Mohamed Bamba,7-0,220,C,Texas,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/mohamed-bamba,"A truly elite physical specimen in terms of length, Mohamed Bamba jumps off the page with his 7'9'' wingspan and 9'6'' standing reach ... This kind of size allowed him to immediately burst on to the NCAA scene as an elite rim protector with the measurables to translate this skill to the NBA ... Blocking 3.7 shots per game during his regular season stint at Texas doesn't even take into account the countless shots he altered or drive attempts he thwarted ... Timing is a part of this, as he only averaged 2.4 fouls per contest at the college level ... His lateral quickness is also very good for a player who measures in at 7 feet tall. This makes him a capable pick and roll defender and someone who roam the entire paint area with little effort ... From a rebounding standpoint, his 10.4 boards per game as a freshman is well above average, and despite his narrow frame he held his own pretty well in the paint against stronger opponents ... While Bamba will always be a lean player, he does have wide shoulders and looks to be able to add muscle ... His 3.2 offensive rebounds per contest is also a very good indicator of timing around the rim ... Mo Bamba's offensive game is probably a little further along than you might initially think ... He is a 67.8% free throw shooter, and has a nice high release and good backspin on his shot ... In an era when long, defensive bigs are often poor free throw shooters, Mo appears to have the foundation to be pretty good at the charity stripe ... His jump shot is also showing signs of life as Bamba shot 28% from the college 3 point line, and showed to be capable from the elbow, while showing decent shot selection ... While his jumper and 3 point shot are not exactly calling cards at this point in his development, I'd still call his foundation as a shooter an strength overall ... He's also a decent ball handler for a big man, and has shown some impressive glimpses of his length and athleticism when putting the ball on the deck and driving past and then dunking on defenders ... He plays with fire, and at the college level when he gets good position and is close to the rim he's extremely tough to stop ... Bamba definitely projects as a defender first at the next level, but he has the pieces in place , with continued development, to be a force on offense as well ... An extremely bright individual, if not for basketball, he had Ivy league grades and credentials entering college ... ","As obvious is as length is, it's also not hard to notice he'll need to continue to add strength to play the paint in the next level ... At the 2017 Hoop Summit, he only weighed in at 216 pounds ... Ideally, you'd like to see Bamba at least around 240 in a year or two, or possibly 250 ... I think those weights are achievable for him judging by his length, and how he's added muscle since high school ... His awareness with his back to the basket and in the paint on offense is a work in progress too ... He'll need to continue to work on his awareness of spacing and cutting players, as well as adjusting to double teams and pressure from guards ... When he's feeling it offensively, he could take over a game at the college level, but he could also be too passive when he'd get bothered ... Restraint is good from a team game perspective, but with his physical tools he should have been more aggressive at times while playing for the Longhorns ... A solid athlete, but much of his wow factor is due to length and not explosiveness or leaping ability ... "
9,New York,Mikal Bridges,6-7,210,SG/SF,Villanova,Jr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/mikal-bridges,"Prototypical 3-and-D wing for the next level ... 6-7 guard/forward with elite length, athleticism and skill set ... Has evolved from being a defensive standout to one of the best outside shooters and wings on the college level ... Quite possibly the best two way player available in this year's draft, and figures to be one of the most NBA ready as well ... Hits three pointers at a high volume, 2.5 three pointers on just under 6 shots per game ... Has a very polished 3-point shot. Great form, accuracy and confidence in his shot: Gets his feet set quickly, has a quick release, good elevation, follow through, and shows range and consistency ... Does most of his damage offensively as a spot up shooter ... Nearly 50% of his shots come from behind the 3point arch where he is extremely efficient (43% from 3)... Has improved his ability to attack the rim off the bounce and finish with dunks ... A +6 or +7 length body type ... His 7-foot wingspan allows him to get shots off with ease as well as being a difficult match up on the defensive end ... Excels on the defensive end and is disruptive with his great length ... Gets in a low defensive stance and covers a lot of ground making it difficult for opponents to get clean looks ... Doesn't gamble for steals and has learned to play sound, fundamental defense after 4 years under Jay Wright at Villanova. He plays the passing lanes well, and is tough to get shots off on due to his length ... An extremely efficient overall offensive player shooting (51.6 fg%, 42.9% 3p, and 84.7% ft) ... Has improved considerably in his junior season going from a key role player to a star (10 ppg to 18 PPG) on the college level and Villanova's go-to athletic scorer ... Has become known for being a clutch shooter, and seems to elevate his play in big moments ... Level headed player who rarely loses his cool ... Solid decision maker, 2.1/1.4 a/to rate ... ","The biggest knock on Bridges is his lack of strength. Not an overly physical player ... His 2.8 FTs made on 3.4 attempts show that he doesn't attack the rim and get to the line a great deal. His FTA/FGA ratio is below 30% at 28.0% ... Has worked hard at adding muscle mass, but remains on the thin side at 210 lbs for a player about to turn 22. Could stand to add another 10 lbs, which would help him to finish through contact and play more physical at both ends. Though he may be a player that lacks the natural body type to carry more weight ... He would also better utilize his great free throw shooting ability by playing more physical and attacking the rim ... Playing alongside one of the nation's best point guards (Jalen Brunson) for his entire college career has been a huge positive for Bridges, but it has also kept him from having to develop as an isolation player ... Has displayed some ability to get to the rim off the bounce and pull up, but remains more of a catch and shoot guy than a driver (96.4% of his 3 pointers come off of assists) ... Took some time to break into a star ... Red-shirted the 2014-15 season, practicing with the team ... Will turn 22 on August 30th, and therefore has maturity but less upside than a number of his fellow draft prospects... Foot speed is solid, especially laterally, but not exceptional ... A good leaper but not great with contact and struggles some to finish after contact or rebound in traffic despite his length ... Generally goes right, so could improve upon attacking off the dribble using his left hand ... Vision and passing a work in progress. Not really a facilitator or a guy that creates open looks for teammates with the drive and dish ... More of a lead by example type, could work on being more vocal now that he's one of the team's stars ..."
10,Philadelphia,Collin Sexton,6-2,185,PG,Alabama,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/collin-sexton,"Sexton is one of the most dynamic guards in the country and has the tools to become a versatile weapon at the NBA level ... Although he is slightly undersized in height at 6-2, he plays with great physicality, athleticism, and aggression, and has a 6'6.5 wingspan and a 8'0 standing reach ... He's a player that loves the spotlight and seems to be energized by the bright lights and stiff competition ... He loves to play through contact and has the frame to absorb it when going to the rim ... He has the strength and athleticism to finish through contact, and he also gets to the free throw line at a very high rate ... Sexton still could stand to become more consistent from the charity stripe, but overall he converts his attempts at a more than proficient level ... Sexton combines his strength with blazing speed, agility, and creative ball handling to form a lethal slashing arsenal ... He does a great job of finding angles to get to the basket and changing directions to keep his defender off balance ... Sexton also does a good job of changing speeds on the perimeter when coming off of ball screens or in isolation ... That allows him to keep his man guessing and much more easily get into the lane ... Sexton is constantly in attack mode looking to make a play ... His wiggle off the dribble naturally leads him to make a play either for himself or a teammate ... Sexton's jumper also looks promising, as he combines his ability to get to the rim with a variety of moves on the perimeter ... He utilizes step backs, pull-ups, and even some mid range fallaways ... He is a dangerous scorer in the mid range area, and even though that is not an essential part of today's game, the best scorers all excel in this area ... While not a pass first point guard, he has the prerequisite vision and playmaking ability needed to be an NBA floor general ... He is a great facilitator in transition, and his ability to get into the lane in the half court allows him to collapse the defense and find open teammates all over the floor ... His aggressive style combined with his explosiveness point towards high upside on the defensive end at the next level ... Sexton also is not afraid of the big moment and does not back down from tougher competition ... He plays with tremendous passion and seems to perform his best in big games ... With his two-way skillset and determination, Sexton has a chance to be a quality lead guard in the NBA ... ","Sexton still has some room for improvement as a slasher despite his explosiveness ... He has the ability to finish with his left hand at the rim but is obviously much more comfortable going right at this stage ... He needs to add a bit more finesse to this department in his game, as he will not be able to rely on sheer athleticism once he reaches the NBA ... His shot selection could also use some polishing ... He tends to force the issue at times and often tries to make the flashy play instead of keeping it simple ... While Sexton has proven to have excellent shot making ability, his balance on his jumper is not always consistent ... He is more of a streaky shooter than a pure knockdown threat at this point ... Sexton is much more of a combo guard than a true point guard, which could hinder his ability to run a team at the next level ... His assist turnover ratio is below two to one, which is less than ideal for a lead guard in the NBA ... He will need to develop into more of a facilitator to maximize his offensive efficiency at the next level ... He also has a tendency to become a bit stationary without the ball in his hands, so his activity off the ball can improve ... "
11,Charlotte,Kevin Knox,6-9,215,SF/PF,Kentucky,Fr.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-knox,"Solid frame, standing 6'9"", 218 pounds, with 7.14% body fat ... Size and length can result in matchup problems for opposing teams. 7' &frac14;"" wingspan. 36 &frac12;"" vertical allows him to rebound over smaller players with relative ease ... Has solid shot mechanics that should translate well to the next level as he already has NBA range ... Is very good at scoring going to the basket, especially with one handed floaters that he can get over virtually any defender ... Can score from the post, allowing for a versatile offensive attack ... Steady improvement throughout his freshman season. Started off poorly on defense to start his college career, but has shown significant growth, especially in terms of staying in front of ball handlers ... Looks to get out in transition when given the opportunity and runs lanes well for the most part, and looks to get to the rim ... Rarely makes careless passes and doesn't stagnate the offense by over dribbling ... Moves well off the ball and uses off ball screens very well to create separation from defenders ... Excellent catch and shoot player from midrange, especially along the baseline ... Can shoot over most defenders and is not afraid to look for his own offense ... When he needs to rebound, can rebound very well ... Won't turn 19 until August 11th. One of the youngest freshmen in college this season, and still has a lot of room to grow ... Reason to believe that his game will develop ... Has the potential to be a solid all around player that can do many different things ...","Motor can run hot and cold, when engaged he is very good, but when not fully engaged he can disappear completely ... His overall game can be affected by his shot, when the shot isn't falling he can start to lose focus ...

Rarely passes the ball in transition, even if it results in him attacking the rim in a 3-on-1 situation ... Will be at a speed and quickness disadvantage against small forwards at the next level ... When the offense goes through other players, he will often coast instead of focusing on rebounding or defense ... Has a tendency to force or settle for long shots instead of attacking defenders ... Has only one move in the post, will need to develop his repertoire further to have success on the low block at the next level ... Not a very efficient player, although some of that is because Kentucky's reliance on him offensively, allowing defenses to key on him ... Doesn't have a noticeable killer instinct or edge to him, sometimes looks content to blend, instead of stand out despite having an immense amount of talent ...

He has ideal size for the point guard position in the NBA at at 6-4 with long arms ... He is not the most explosive athlete, but he has a very high basketball IQ for a player his age and makes great decisions with the ball ... As a freshman, Shamet posted a three to one assist to turnover ratio for the season. ..While that has gone down slightly this year due to an increased workload, he is still averaging an outstanding 2.5 assists to one turnover ... He always plays the game under control and commands the offense exceptionally well ... Shamet has the ability to play at several different speeds with the ball in his hands and gets his teammates the ball in rhythm and where they can make plays ... He is also terrific in pick-and-roll situations, where he ranks in the 79th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball handler because of his ability to make plays for others while not getting sped up ... Shamet has proven to be a versatile offensive player, making the switch from shooting guard to point guard last year ... While primarily used as a point guard at Wichita State, he is a very efficient offensive player off the ball as well, as he ranks third in college basketball in points per possession (1.521) off of spot-up situations (100th percentile) ... In an NBA that particularly emphasizes offensive versatility nowadays, Shamet's ability to play both on and off the ball at a high level will serve him quite well ... He is a good passer, but the skill that will best translate to the NBA is his shooting ability ... His size allows him to shoot over the top of smaller guards, and he has a beautiful mid-range pull-up jump-shot, which cannot be said about most college guards ...

He is shooting 44 percent from three this season, the second consecutive year that he has shot over 41 percent from downtown ... He is also a very good free throw shooter, having recorded two straight seasons with at least an 80 percent clip ... Despite underwhelming athleticism, he is crafty, picks his spots wisely and is surprisingly an excellent finisher at the rim (59.1 percent) ...","While he does in large part make up for it with his high-IQ and skill, Shamet's lack of burst off the dribble will limit his upside at the next level ... At the college level, it does not hinder him that often, but in the NBA he will be up against much more explosive and skilled guards every single night ... Shamet also still has some developing to do, physically, in order to reach his full potential ... He will need to add some strength and muscle in order for him to endure a full NBA season and withstand the physicality of the pro game ... While he is a very good finisher at the basket in college, it will be much more difficult to replicate in the NBA without him adding a few pounds of muscle, especially since he does not have elite explosiveness to compensate for it ... There will also be questions about what to do with Shamet defensively at the next level ... While he has the size and length to challenge point guards, he struggles to stay in front of quicker players ... He may have to be a guy that relies on his length to come up with steals and blocks in order to at least be semi-productive on the defensive end ... However, forcing turnovers or contesting shots has never been a true strength of his ... Shamet has also had multiple foot injuries throughout his career, so there may be concerns of whether that will continue to be an issue going forward ... "

He is still learning the point guard position because he began his career as an off guard ... Gets sped up and plays too fast at times ... Has problems reading the game ...Turnover prone, his assist/turnover ratio could improve ... He must learn to take over a game when he has to ... He can be a streaky shooter ... He occasionaly shows a little hesitation before shooting off the dribble which causes him to lose a split second and allows his opponent to contest his shot ... He can fall in love with his shot and not attack the basket as much as he should ... He settles for a 3-point more times than he should after a big is switched on him ...

33,Atlanta,Tony Carr,6-5,200,PG,Penn State,So.,http://www.nbadraft.net/players/tony-carr,"In his sophomore season, Tony Carr blossomed into a First-Team All-Big Ten point guard following an up and down freshman season ... A big reason for that was his much-improved jump shot, particularly from beyond the arc . Last season Carr shot just 32 percent from downtown on three attempts per game ... This year, however, he has ascended his three-point percentage all the way to 46 percent and has done so on just under six attempts per game . Carr's improved three-point shot has opened up the rest of his offensive arsenal, which allowed prompted him average a Big Ten best 19.9 points per game this season ... Carr has very good size and length for a lead guard at 6-5 and can get shots off over smaller defenders ... He is an excellent shot creator off the dribble and has become a serious threat to score in the mid-range area via pull-ups, step backs, spin dribbles, etc ... When he gets inside the arc he does a great job of using his size and length to shoot over the top of smaller defenders ... Carr also can take other guards down in the post, where he is comfortable operating as a scorer or playmaker ... He has proficient scoring instincts and understands how to get to spots where he is most effective in different situations ... Carr has also improved as a pick-and-roll ball handler and plays with nice patience in the half-court. Rarely does he get too sped up or out of control when coming off of ball screens ... Carr is a capable playmaker as well and has improved his assist to turnover ratio in his sophomore season ... When he keeps his eyes up and does not try to force the issue, he has shown flashes of solid vision ... Carr is a good free-throw shooter as well, at nearly 80 percent for the second season in a row ... He his size and length, he has some defensive upside as well, despite not being the most explosive vertical athlete ... If he can learn to become more active with his hands on the ball, he could be a guy that records a lot of steals and blocks ... Carr is also a good rebounder for a lead guard, averaging nearly five boards per game in each of his first two seasons ... He is also clearly not afraid of the big moment, as he made some big time shots late in games this season, most notably to beat Ohio State on the road and one to tie it regulation against Minnesota with time winding down ... ","Carr lacks elite burst off the dribble and does not always explode to the basket when he turns the corner ... He is also not the most explosive leaper, which hinders his ability to finish at the rim at times ... That will limit his defensive upside in the NBA, as he is not quite big enough to guard NBA two-guards, but he does not have the lateral quickness to consistently stay in front of the dynamic point guards that he will see most nights in the pros ... Carr also struggles to score against more physical defenders ... Despite having a solid 6-5 foundation to work with, he checks in under 210 pounds and can be pushed off his spots fairly easily, so he will need to add some strength at the next level ... There are questions if Carr's improved shooting may be a bit of a fluke ... Mechanically, there are no glaring hitches to his release, but his ball does not have great rotation ... Will he be able to get away with this behind a deeper NBA three-point line? The biggest knock on Carr at this stage is his inefficiency ... Last year he shot just 37 percent from the field, and while he did improve this season, he still made only a pedestrian 41 percent of his field goal attempts ... Carr is much more of a volume scorer, as he had to take a lot of shots from the field in many of his high-scoring games this season ... A big reason for that is he does not get to the free-throw line at a high rate ... For the second season in a row, Carr attempted just 4.8 free throw attempts per game, which is indicative of his tendency to settle for contested jump shots at times ... His shot selection needs some work, as he is a bit ball dominant and often tries to play hero ball instead of running the offense like you typically want from a true point guard ... The other major concern with Carr is that, outside of his perimeter shooting, he really has not improved substantially in any area since last year ... Obviously, he scored the ball at a higher rate this year, but he made just marginal strides as both a playmaker and a defender ... With his limited athleticism, he is going to have to become more than just a volume scorer if he plans to carve out any substantial role for an NBA team ... "

The best way to describe his body is a young Ginobili, similar kind of smoothness and control of his body ... He had at least one steal per game showing excellent ability to anticipate passes and the closing speed to get to the ball for steals ... But what really makes him special is his creativity and skill level ... Mykhaliuk is equally confortable with the ball in his hands or without, which is highly unusual for a 16 year old ... He played for large minutes as a combo guard (at U16) running pick and rolls for Ukraine and he showed that he can shoot from behind screens from 3pts land or attack the rim but also read the defense to make great passes ... Mykhaliuk can read the screen to take advantage of what the defense gives him ... He often attacks players in isolation, taking smaller opponents into the post ... When he doesn't have the ball, he cuts to try to find a spot where he is open ... When he struggles shooting, he attacks the basket to get fouls. The variety of ways in which he scored was absolutely amazing for a player his age ... Despite being doubled or tripled teamed every game, he always stays composed, making the right decision most of the time ... On defense he has everything to be great, quick feet and good lateral speed and he uses his length to create steals and get out on the break ... Sometimes when he is of the ball he tends to lose his defenders, but nevertheless he relentlessly hits the boards and when he gets the rebound push it himself in Lebronian way ...","Mostly related to a lack of potential development. He can do everything so well right now that it's hard to think he will actually add a great deal to his game. So the challenge will be finding ways to improve ... Obviously he can improve his left hand, and the ball handling (although it is amazing right now) needs some improvements to be efficient in the NBA as a point guard ... Mostly for him it will be important to adapt himself to playing within a good team where he is forced to share the spotlight ... Ironically I think his talent could shine even more because he is a very underrated passer who had some amazing assists you can't teach in a gym, but moving to a good team could still be difficult for him ... While he has to become stronger to be able to guard NBA guards, he will have to be carefully with his body development in order not to lose some of his unique athletic skills ... He is basically an Adetokumbo who should be considered until proven differently, a future top 10 NBA pick ..."

Showing great shooting touch, Newman sported very efficient shooting percentages from the floor ... Sporting clips of 46% FG, 41% from three, and 86% from the stripe ... All these clips are drastic increases from his freshman season at Mississippi State where his suspect shot selection tanked his shooting numbers ... As a redshirt sophomore, Malik showed the NBA translatable skill of being a deadly spot up shooter and floor spacer for the Jayhawks ... He also acted as a secondary ball handler, and that he could be capable in pick and roll situations despite not being a natural point guard ... One of his major strengths is his ability to man the defensive glass and push the tempo ... His 5 rebounds per game (4.5 defensive) was an extremely high number for a 6'3'' player ... This strength paired well with his ability as a straight line driver, allowed him to be a major threat in transition ... In today's wide open NBA landscape, a guard who's capable of hitting the glass and pushing the tempo in transition is a valuable thing in which to excel ... As mentioned earlier, Newman is only 6'3'' but he was able to finish around the rim at 60% (according to hoop-math.com) which is a good number for a player of his size and athletic profile ... Athletically he's very quick and has good end to end speed, while not overly athletic, he's pretty well muscled and is in very good shape from a conditioning standpoint (averaged 37.8 mpg in the NCAA tournament, and always had great energy) ... He's improved a lot as a defender, and should be capable of guarding NBA point guards ... Malik Newman showed great maturity at Kansas, and proved he was capable of meshing with a team with bona fide standout and still find a way excel at what he does best ... ","Malik is not a point guard, and lacks the size to guard NBA two guards ... His 6'5.5'' wingspan is solid for a 6'3'' player, but not enough to make think he could handle any position other than an NBA point, defensively ... From a leaping standard he's solid, but not elite ... Not an above the rim player, NBA rim protectors could give him issues ... He has seen the likes of Mo Bamba, Wendel Carter Jr, and Sagaba Konate and fared well, but seeing elite rim protectors night in and night out could diminish some of his effectiveness as a driver ... While he's improved his shot selection mightily, he can still fall back into bad habits and force contested mid-range jumpers when trying to find rhythm ... Can get a little reckless in transition at times, and go head on into 1-3 situations ... He'll need to temper this part of his game if he hopes to maximize his ability to push the ball on the break ... "

His strength allows him to maintain great body control in the air and finish acrobatically at the rim ... He is a good ball handler and uses his size well to get into the lane ... Alkins is also proficient at creating offense for himself and is a capable shot maker from all over the floor ... He particularly excels at scoring off the move and off the dribble ... He plays an up-tempo attacking style and constantly puts pressure on the defense ... Alkins has good burst and a quick first step ... He is not a great shooter, but he has an improving three point shot that could continue to get better in the future ... He also uses a nice step back jumper and overall good scoring touch ... He almost looks like a man among boys against players his age with a combination of power and athleticism ... Alkins is also a solid rebounder for his position, a category in which he averages just fewer than five per game in his freshman season at Arizona ... His combination of strength and athleticism allows him to carve out space and out-compete other guards for loose balls ... Although he did not assume the role of a primary playmaker this past season, he is a decent playmaker with potential to improve in this area as well ... Alkins' defensive potential is also enticing, as he has quick feet that allow him to guard multiple positions ... He has the strength and size to contain bigger guards, while maintaining the foot speed to stay in front of smaller, quicker guards ... ","As physically imposing as Alkins is, many of his skills have some catching up to do ... He tends to force the issue at times on offense and could improve his shot selection ... While he has potential as a playmaker for his ability to put pressure on the defense, he doesn't do a good job of moving the ball and getting teammates involved at this stage ... He is also not a consistent above the rim player and doesn't have great length ... Alkins also does not always put in the effort on defense or get back in transition, and he has a bad tendency to reach for steals and commit fouls instead of sliding his feet and staying in front of his man ... He doesn't yet understand how to best utilize his physical tools, especially on the defensive end of the floor ... His occasional disinterest defensively tends to impact his reactions and lateral quickness, and he can give up easy straight line drives ... Offensively, he tends to be a little upright and will need to learn to play lower to the ground to be as effective getting to the rim in a half-court game ... While his shot is improving (37% 3s), he could still become a bit more consistent from the perimeter to open up his driving game ... He is also at times out of control on offense, leading to turnovers, and he does not have a great feel for the game (averaged almost as many turnovers as assists this past season) ... Alkins is undersized at 6'4 to play the shooting guard position and tends to rely too much on his raw strength ... He also played more of a subordinate role at Arizona this season with players like <a class='nba_player-link' href='/players/allonzo-trier'>Allonzo Trier</a> and <a class='nba_player-link' href='/players/lauri-markkanen'>Lauri Markkanen</a> being the go-to offensive players ... Will he be able to assume a larger offensive role?"
